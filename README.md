Ad Silence
=========

The goal of this project is to collect acoustic and ambient light sensor data 
from a television broadcast using an Android device in an attempt to determine 
when that broadcast switches from the current program to an advertisement, at 
which time the device, also acting as a remote control, will mute the tv.
When the advertisements are complete, the app will then unmute the tv.



Version 1.0
=========

+ Uses only the Android Light Sensor.
+ Writes data to text file (Time, Value) on changed sensor reading.
